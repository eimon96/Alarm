# ATTENTION!

To run Alarm app properly you must:

-Give permission Appear On Top in settings.

-Deactivate battery optimizers for this app. (VERY IMPORTANT)

-Allow notifications.



# Things you must know:

-The alarm does not activates if your device is turned off.

-If you reboot your device you have to set the alarm from scratch.

-If you dont see the notification around, the alarm is NOT set.

-The alarm is one shot, not repeating daily.

-Alarm sound triggers even if the phone is in silent mode or do-not-disturbed mode.
